Description: Takes in a csv file from the current R project folder in quotes (ex: "file_name.csv"), 
    the train set percentage, and the test set percentage. The function reads the csv file and creates
    a train and test set from the specified percentages. The output is a list where the first index 
    returns the training set and the second index refers to the testing set. 
    Example of naming train and test set after running: data <- train_test("train_copy.csv", 0.7, 0.3), 
    train <- data[1], test <- data[2].
